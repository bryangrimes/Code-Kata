Bootstrap for TDD Kata
======================

Basic bootstrap for .net and javascript for my team to practice [Roy Osherovs's TDD kata](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

The steps are captured in the Powerpoint file to discourage reading ahead!

The javascript test uses Jasmine and is self contained.  Just run SpecRunner.html in a browser and start editing the code and tests in the src and specs directory.

The .Net sample requires Visual Studio and [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)

Both samples are set at step 1 with a failing test.
